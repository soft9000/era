Students looking to see the testing versions - as discussed in the training (above) - can follow the UML Use-Case Named Deltas, as checked-in, in their video-presentatin order, for ezlog02.py, as well.

Folks looking to learn more about Python 3 can join us at https://www.facebook.com/groups/Python3Training ... as of this week, we're now over 10,000 'Pythoneers strong.
