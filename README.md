# Mission
Evolving across the decades, today the purpose of **ERA** is to:

(1) Allow us to use any **C**ommand **L**ine User **I**nterface (**CLI**) to maintain our events & messages in readily editable text files.

(2) Permit us to work on those files between that **CLI** and a cross-platform **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (**GUI**.)

(3) Use Python 3 to create our own _customizable_ logging format!

Here is an overview of what [AboutTime can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohJfGX-EjoU).


## Technologies
The **ERA Project** can be re-created wherever the GNU toolchain is installed. Those unfamiliar with how to use GNU tools might wish to enroll in the [GNU Tool Primer](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-gnu-tool-primer/?referralCode=E858B2C2AC9CD872A100).

## AboutTime: EzLog GUI
The Ezlog C/C++ logging application updates an `.ezlog` file. The `.ezlog` file can also be monitored & updated in real-time from Java using the [AboutTime Desktop](https://github.com/soft9000/AboutTime/tree/master/AboutTimeDesktop) GUI.

## Python Logger
The [Python Editions](https://github.com/soft9000/era/blob/master/ezlog03.py) are stand alone. -Part of my [DevOps](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-4000-gnu-devops/?referralCode=E04F0744698A4BE930D7) educational opportunity.

## The `era` Project
Binding it all together, the `era` project is about simple &amp; effective date, time, and modern ezlog-style logging @ the console. C++ is the core - Java can be used for a stellar visualization. -The Python 3 edition is a new all-in-one project that we can enjoy without using anything else.

Pythoneers looking for the latest version of 'ezlog.py' should be using [ezlog03.py](https://github.com/soft9000/era/blob/master/ezlog03.py). Just download, then rename it?

Students looking to see the testing versions - as discussed in the training (above) - can follow the UML Use-Case Named Deltas, as checked-in, in their video-presentation order, for ezlog02.py, as well.

Folks looking to learn more about Python 3 can join us at [Python3 Training](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Python3Training) ... as of this week, we're almost over 20,000 'Pythoneers strong!
