# AboutTime: EzLog Console Logger
The Ezlog C/C++ logging application updates an `.ezlog` file. The `.ezlog` file can also be monitored & updated in real-time by the [AboutTime Desktop](https://github.com/soft9000/AboutTime/tree/master/AboutTimeDesktop) GUI.

# AboutTime: Python Logger
The [Python Editions](https://github.com/soft9000/era/blob/master/ezlog03.py) are stand alone. -Part of my [DevOps](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-4000-gnu-devops) educational opportunity.

# The `era` Project
Binding it all together, the `era` project is about simple &amp; effective date, time, and modern ezlog-style logging @ the console.

Both are also used by ["Python 4000: Linux Commands & DevOps Automation"](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-4000-gnu-devops)

Pythoneers looking for the latest version of 'ezlog.py' should be using [ezlog03.py](https://github.com/soft9000/era/blob/master/ezlog03.py). Just download, then rename it?

Students looking to see the testing versions - as discussed in the training (above) - can follow the UML Use-Case Named Deltas, as checked-in, in their video-presentation order, for ezlog02.py, as well.

Folks looking to learn more about Python 3 can join us at [Python3 Training](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Python3Training) ... as of this week, we're almost over 20,000 'Pythoneers strong!
